    "## Gravitational Waves\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Gravitational waves are \"basically\" self propogating perturbations in the space-time metric, generated by the time evolution of the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution, in particular it's 3rd time derivative.\r\n",

    "## White Dwarfs\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "White dwarfs are remanants of most main sequence stars. Anything under 8 solar masses, they are degenerate, their electrons occupy Fermi degenerate energy levels. Their composition tends to be either Helium core or core made of carbon and oxygen as a result of fusion.  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Something interesting about Helium core stars is they can be formed only through binary evolution (find out why).  \r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "The above equation says the orbital period (in days) in which an object will overflow its Roche Lobe is approximately $\\frac{0.43}{\\text{sqare root of its density (given in}\\frac{gm}{cm^3})}$\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When two stars like Sun are born in a close orbit, they can leave behind compact binary white dwarfs. It is thought that when these systems merge, they can result in a Type 1a supernova, which are extremely important in measuring cosmological distances.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "These close Binary systems containing white dwarfs will be the vast majority of what LISA detects.\r\n"
